      "SmartPyLogger is a lightweight FastAPI tool for developers, built in under two weeks at the 2025 AWS x Couchbase x Cillers hackathon by Niklavs Visockis, Jonas Lorenz, and Ludvig Bergström. It logs all requests, analyzes them with AI, blocks or flags suspicious traffic via CORS/IP rules, and comes as a pip-installable package with a real backend, UI, auth, and payments. Designed with a no-fluff, dev-first mindset — no landing page, just working code.",
